#  Morse Code Translator
As a kid at school, me and my friends loved to write little Ciphers when passing notes in the classroom to keep our messages between ourselves, one of our favourites was Morse Code.
<br /> <br />
This translator takes the pain out of encrypting and decrypting Morse code messages, since it does it for you! It uses key value pairs inside JavaScript to translate each letter of Morse to English (or vice-versa). <br />
Although I won't be messaging my friends on Facebook in Morse Code, maybe you could! <br /><br />
Google Translate could learn a thing or two from this honestly.
